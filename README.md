# ChessAI
A chess engine made using an ANN.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
To build a fully functional AI using a ANN architecture that would facilitate the best learning. This project is still in the making

<h2>Functions</h2>
The project has to meet two goals (as far as we can see now)
  <ol>
  <li>1.Play a game against a human player without any intervention</li>
  <l1>2.Function as an expert-chess player that can create it's own moves</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
This area covers the objectives that the application would have to meet
  <ol>
  <l1>1. User-friendly</li>
  2. Easy to understand
  3. Fast and efficient
  4. Robust
  </ol>
  
<h2>Constraints</h2>
This area highlights the constraints the AI application would have
  1. A set time limit to make the moves
  2. Play within the game rules
  3. Fairly easy to train 
  4. Cheap for building and maintaining (under a $100)

<h2>Means</h2>
This area covers the techniques, libraries, and other tools we used to accomplish this task (as far as we can see)
  1. Numpy
  2. SciKit Learn
  3. Tensorflow
  4. Anaconda
