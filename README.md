# ChessAI
A chess engine made using an ANN.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
To build a fully functional AI using a ANN architecture that would facilitate the best learning. This project is still in the making

##Functions
The project has to meet two goals (as far as we can see now)
  1.Play a game against a human player without any intervention
  2.Function as an expert-chess player that can create it's own moves

##Objectives
This area covers the objectives that the application would have to meet
  1. User-friendly
  2. Easy to understand
  3. Fast and efficient
  4. Robust
  
##Constraints
This area highlights the constraints the AI application would have
  1. A set time limit to make the moves
  2. Play within the game rules
  3. Fairly easy to train 
  4. Cheap for building and maintaining (under a $100)

##Means
This area covers the techniques, libraries, and other tools we used to accomplish this task (as far as we can see)
  1. Numpy
  2. SciKit Learn
  3. Tensorflow
  4. Anaconda
