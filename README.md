# ChessAI
A chess engine made using an ANN.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
To build a fully functional AI using a ANN architecture that would facilitate the best learning. This project is still in the making

<h2>Functions</h2>
The project has to meet two goals (as far as we can see now)
  <ol>
  <li>Play a game against a human player without any intervention</li>
  <li>Function as an expert-chess player that can create it's own moves</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
This area covers the objectives that the application would have to meet
  <ol>
  <li>User-friendly</li>
  <li>Easy to understand</li>
  <li>Fast and efficient</li>
  <li>Robust</li>
  </ol>
  
<h2>Constraints</h2>
This area highlights the constraints the AI application would have
  <ol>
  <li>A set time limit to make the moves</li>
  <li>Play within the game rules</li>
  <li>Fairly easy to train</li>
  <li>Cheap for building and maintaining (under a $100)</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Means</h2>
This area covers the techniques, libraries, and other tools we used to accomplish this task (as far as we can see)
  <ol>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>SciKit Learn</li>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>Anaconda</li>
  </ol>
